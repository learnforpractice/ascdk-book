    "A smart contract is code that can be executed on the blockchain.\n",

    "## What is a Python Smart Contract\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python smart contract is code written in Python that can be executed on the blockchain. In the case of the EOS network, Python smart contract code is compiled into a WebAssembly binary file, which can be published to the blockchain and executed, achieving a certain operation effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is EOS\n",
    "\n",
    "EOS is a blockchain network based on the Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS) consensus algorithm. The main network was officially launched on June 8, 2018. The EOS mainnet is controlled by 21 Block Producers (BP) who are elected by voting and are responsible for packaging transactions into blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Account\n",
    "\n",
    "On the EOS blockchain, each transaction entity is represented by an account. The account name is a `name` structure, which will be discussed in the next section. The account structure in C++ code is relatively complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is a brief overview of the information contained in an account, based on the information returned by EOS's `get_account` RPC interface with the following code:"

    "Let's briefly introduce the meanings of the main fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `account_name`: Account name, the rules will be discussed in the next section\n",
    "- `privileged`: `true` indicates that the account is a privileged account, such as `eosio` being a privileged account. `false` means it's a regular account\n",
    "- `last_code_update`: The last update time of the smart contract in the account\n",
    "- `created`: Account creation time\n",
    "- `core_liquid_balance`: Account's available balance\n",
    "- `ram_quota`: Total memory allocated to the account. Since the EOS database is an in-memory database, all on-chain data must be stored in memory, and memory is limited, so memory is allocated as a resource to accounts.\n",
    "- `net_weight`: The weight of the network resources allocated to the account\n",
    "- `cpu_weight`: The weight of the CPU resources allocated to the account\n",
    "- `net_limit`: Account's network resource usage\n",
    "- `cpu_limit`: CPU resource usage\n",
    "- `ram_usage`: Already used memory\n",
    "- `permissions`: Account permissions; account permissions contain one or more public keys or account information, each public key and account permission occupies a certain weight, when sending a transaction, the private key corresponding to the public key must be used to sign the transaction, and the weight must be greater or equal to the `threshold` for the transaction to be recognized by BP. When the permissions of the account contain not public key information but designate inherited permissions from a certain account, the public key information will be extracted from the permission information of this account during signing, which is implemented through the algorithm of the C++ program. EOS's RPC interface also has a `get_required_keys` interface to obtain the public key information for signing.\n",
    "- `total_resources`: This specifies the information of resources allocated to the account, such as NET, CPU, RAM, etc.\n",
