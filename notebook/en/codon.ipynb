    "# Differences between Codon and standard Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is generally referred to as a dynamic language that generates relatively high-level virtual machine instructions (byte code) at compile time. When Python programs are executed, they are still interpreted by a specialized virtual machine program. The advantage is that the code is very flexible and supports dynamic modification of the code, but the disadvantage is that the execution speed is slow. The earliest Python smart contract was executed in this way. Later, in order to solve the problem of slow Python code execution speed, many solutions emerged, including tools like Codon that directly compile Python code into machine code that can be executed directly. The Python smart contract later adopted the Codon compiler, which not only preserves the ease of use of writing Python code, but also ensures execution speed. However, due to the different compilation methods, the generated target files are different, and the execution method is different from that of standard Python programs, so there are some differences in compatibility between Codon compiled Python code and standard Python code. Let's introduce these differences below to avoid confusion when writing smart contracts.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it is necessary to explain that the executable file generated after compiling the smart contract code in Python is in WebAssembly instructions, with a file extension of .wasm. In reality, there is no CPU that can execute WebAssembly instructions directly, and in most cases, they also need to be interpreted by a specialized virtual machine program during execution, but only binary code is executed. This is similar to Python's virtual machine executing byte code, but WebAssembly's instructions are more low-level than Python's virtual machine instructions, and are safer, so they can be easily translated into system machine code to optimize execution speed by JIT or AOT. In the EOS blockchain, smart contract code can be executed by `eosvm` using JIT, or by interpreting the instructions, or even by compiling into machine code that can be directly executed by the system. Python's virtual machine instructions are difficult to execute completely by JIT and AOT.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, Python smart contracts use a static compiler like Codon, sacrificing some compatibility with standard Python code for the benefit of significantly improved execution speed and security."
